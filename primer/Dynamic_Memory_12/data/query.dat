The squat and bench press numbers are lifetime PRs for me, which feels great to say. 
At my strongest point in 2017, I hit 5 on squat, which might be more impressive 
than 425
I'm getting close to a benchmark I've always had in the back of my mind:
the elusive 300-400-500 club for bench, squat, and deadlift. Technically, 
I'm already a member (I deadlifted 501 in 2016), but I always thought it would be cool to do all three in one workout. Maybe in 2018.
